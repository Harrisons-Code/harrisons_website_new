            <h2>Discourses</h2>

<p>Quotes and sections I liked from <i>Discourses by Epictetus</i>
<br>
<br>
"Reason is unique among the faculties assigned to us in being able to evaluate itself - what is, what it is capable of, how valuable it is - in its addition to passing judgement on others", "I must die. But must I die bawling? I must be put in chains - but moaning and groaning too? I must be exiled; but is there anything to keep me from going with a smile, calm and self-composed?"
<br>
<br>
"Consider at what price you sell your integrity; but please for God's sake, don't sell it cheap', "Make it your goal never to fail in your desires or experience things you would rather avoid; try never to err in impulse and repulsion; aim to perfect also in the practice of attention and withholding your judgement", "Where is progress, then? If there is anyone who renounces externals and attends instead to their character, cultivating and perfecting it so that it agrees with nature, making it honest and trustworthy, elevated, free, unchecked and undeterred; and if they've learned that whoever desires or avoids things outside their control cannot be free or faithful, but has to shift and uctuate right along with them, subject to anyone with the power to furnish or deprive them of these externals; and if from the moment they get up in the morning they adhere to their ideals, eating and bathing like a person of integrity, putting their principles into practice in every situation they face – the way a runner does when he applies the principles of running, or a singer those of musicianship – that is where you will see true progress embodied, and nd someone who has not wasted their time making the journey here from home."
<br>
<br>
"‘But my nose is running!’ What do you have hands for, idiot, if not to wipe it? ‘But how is it right that there be running noses in the rst place?’ Instead of thinking up protests, wouldn't it be easier just to wipe your nose?", "What would have become of Hercules, do you think, if there had been no lion, hydra, stag or boar – and no savage criminals to rid the world of? What would he have done in the absence of such challenges? Obviouslyhe would have just rolled over in bed and gone back to sleep. So by snoring his life away in luxury and comfort he never would have developed into the mighty Hercules. And even if he had, what good would it have done him? What would have been the use of those arms, that physique, and that noble soul, without crises or conditions to stir him into action? ‘In that case, perhaps he should have created them himself, by searching for a lion to bring into his land, and a boar and a hydra.’ That would have been the act of a fool and a fanatic. Still, by showing up and being discovered, they proved useful as tests of Hercules' manhood.", "Establish what is true, eliminate what is false and suspend judgement in doubtful cases"
<br>
<br>
"no one is better equipped to argue skillfully than the philosopher", "no one is ever unhappy because of someone else", "you have the power of patience to deal with your difficulties", "philosophy does not claim to secure for us anything outside our control", "Stoics put logic at the head of our curriculum - for the same reason that, before a quantity of grain can be measured, we must settle on a standard of measurement", "if we haven't fully grasped or refined the intrument by which we analyse and understand other things, how can we hope to understand them with any precision?", "you have a will incapable of being coerced or compelled', "One impulse can only be overrulled by another", "Don't attatch such value to your clothes, and you won't get angry with the theif who takes them", "A man only loses what he has. ... Loss and sorrow are only possible with respect to things we own", "We should discipline ourselves in small things, and from there progress to things of greater value", "Nothing important comes into being overnight; even grapes or figs need time to ripen. If you say that you want a fig now, I will tell you to be patient. First, you must allow the tree to ower, then put forth fruit; then you have to wait until the fruit is ripe. So if the fruit of a fig tree is not brought to maturity instantly or in an hour, how do you expect the human mind to come to fruition, so quickly and easily? Don't expect it, even if I were personally to tell you it was possible."
<br>
<br>
"When someone is properly grounded in life, they shouldn't have to look outside themselves for approval"
<br>
<br>
"The true man is revealed in difficult times", " then why do we continue to experience fear and anxiety? No one has power over our principles, and what other people do control we don't care about. So what is your problem, still?  
", "Protect what belongs to you at all costs; don't desire what belongs to another.", "It is for you to arrange your priorities; but whatever you decide to do, don't do it resentfully, as if you were being imposed on", " In general, remember that it is we who torment, we who make diculties for ourselves – that is, our opinions do.", "That is what Socrates practised, maintaining always the same even temper.", "What aid can we find to combat habit? The opposed habit.", "No, I cannot escape death, but at least I can escape the fear of it – or do I have to die moaning and groaning too?", "if you can't change a person's mind, realize that he is no more than a child – and clap hands with him. And if you can't bring yourself to do that, then just keep quiet. ", "No, when the crisis comes, we groan and say, 'I wanted to keep on learning.' Keep learning what? If you didn't learn these things in order to demonstrate them in practice, what did you learn them for?", "man is an animal made for abstract thought.", "Man is not the master of another man, only death and life are, pleasure and pain."
<br>
<br>
"Pain too is just a scary mask: look under it and you will see. The body sometimes suffers, but relief is never far behind.", "Whenever externals are more important to you than your own integrity, then be prepared to serve them the remainder of your life."
<br>
<br>
"So in life our rst job is this, to divide and distinguish things into two categories: externals I cannot control, but the choices I make with regard to them I do control. Where will I nd good and bad? In me, in my choices. Don't ever speak of 'good' or 'bad', 'advantage' or 'harm', and so on, of anything that is not your responsibility.", "No one can force you to hold an opinion against your will.", "That is the way things are weighed and disagreements settled – when standards are established.", "the wise man is advised to make use of their ndings right away. ", "Well, when a guide meets up with someone who is lost, ordinarily his reaction is to direct him on the right path, not mock or malign him, then turn on his heel and walk away. As for you, lead someone to the truth and you will nd that he can follow. But as long as you don't point it out to him, don't make fun of him; be aware of what you need to work on instead. "
<br>
<br>
"You might as well get on your knees and pray that your nose won't run. A better idea would be to wipe your nose and forgo the prayer."
<br>
<br>
"It is inevitable that continuous behaviour of any one kind ig going to instil new habits and tendencies, while steadily comfirming old ones", "don't feed your  
temper, or multiply incidents of anger. Suppress the resist impulse to be angry, then begin to count the days on which you don't get mad ... 'I didn't lose my temper this day, or the next, and not for two, then three months in succession.' If you can say that, you are now in excellent health, believe me. ", "socialize with men of good character, in order to model your life on theirs, whether you choose someone living or someone from the past.", "Everything can be classied as good, bad or indierent. The virtues, and the things that share in them, are good. The vices and what shares in them are bad. Everything in between is indierent, like wealth, health, life, death and poverty.' "
<br>
<br>
"It is a universal law – have no illusions – that every creature alive is attached to nothing so much as to its own self-interest.", "what can obstruct the will? Nothing external; only the will can turn back on, and obstruct, itself.", " But if I'm asked to name the greatest element of all, what am I to say? The faculty of speech? I cannot. It is the faculty of the will, when rightly applied, since it controls speech as well as every other faculty, great and small. It is by putting this right that a good person becomes good; when its purpose fails, he turns bad. It determines whether we are to know happiness or not, and whether we will be on hostile or amicable terms with our neighbours. Simply put – ignore it and unhappiness results, give it your attention and your happiness is assured.", "Death too is indifferent, so dismiss it from your mind.", "when you engage in the same things as the masses, you lower yourself to their level.", "'One person likes tending to his farm, another to his horse; I like to daily monitor my selfimprovement.", "It is inevitable if you enter into relations with people on a regular basis, either for conversation, dining or simple friendship, that you will grow to be like them, unless you can get them to emulate you. Place an extinguished piece of coal next to a live one, and either it will cause the other one to die out, or the live one will make the other reignite. Since a lot is at stake, you should be careful about fraternizing with non-philosophers in these contexts; remember that if you consort with someone covered in dirt you can hardly avoid getting a little grimy yourself."
<br>
<br>
"With him there is no premature assent, mistaken impulse, frustrated desire, unsuccessful aversion or unrealized purpose; hence no blame, envy or humiliation", "How would you like it if your children acted that way?', "Rufus4 used to say, 'If you have nothing better to do than praise me for it, then my speech was a failure.' " - apply this to business, "Free is the person who lives as he wishes and cannot be coerced, impeded or compelled, whose impulses cannot be thwarted, who always gets what he desires and never has to experience what he would rather avoid. "
<br>
<br>
"Don't be surprised if so great a goal costs you many a sacrice.", "the things that  
men admire and work so hard to get prove useless to them once they're theirs. Meanwhile people to whom such things are still denied come to imagine that everything good will be theirs if only they could acquire them. Then they get them: and their longing is unchanged, their anxiety is unchanged, their disgust is no less, and they still long for whatever is lacking.  Freedom is not achieved by satisfying desire, but by eliminating it.", "You should be especially careful when associating with one of your former friends or acquaintances not to sink to their level; otherwise you will lose yourself. If you are troubled by the idea that 'He'll think I'm boring and won't treat me the way he used to,' remember that everything comes at a price. It isn't possible to change your behaviour and still be the same person you were before.", "So choose: either regain the love of your old friends by reverting to your former self or remain better than you once were and forfeit their aection. And if you choose the latter, stick to it from here on out. Don't give in to second thoughts, because no one who wavers will make progress. And if you are committed to making progress and ready to devote yourself to the eort, then give up everything else. Otherwise your ambivalence will only ensure that you don't make progress, and you won't even get to revisit the pleasures of the past. "
<br>
<br>
"True peace is characterized by nothing so much as steadiness and imperturbability.", "I cannot call somebody 'hard-working' knowing only that they read and write. Even if 'all night long' is added, I cannot say it – not until I know the focus of all this energy."
<br>
<br>
"According to Favorinus, Epictetus would also say that there were two vices much blacker and more serious than the rest: lack of persistence and lack of self-control. The former means we cannot bear or endure hardships that we have to endure, the latter means that we cannot resist pleasures or other things we ought to resist. 'Two words,' he says, 'should be committed to memory and obeyed by alternately exhorting and restraining ourselves, words that will ensure we lead a mainly blameless and untroubled life.' These two words, he used to say, were 'persist and resist'.", " virtue is more valuable than wealth to the same degree that eyes are more valuable than fingernails." , "We should realize that an opinion is not easily formed unless a person says and hears the same things every day and practises them in real life.", " 'Poor me, because this happened to me.' No, say rather, 'Lucky me, because though this happened to me I'm still happy, neither broken by present circumstance nor afraid for the future.' Because the same thing could have happened to anyone, but not everyone could have remained content. So why is the former a misfortune any more than the latter is a blessing? Do you actually call anything a human misfortune that isn't a perversion of human nature? And don't you think a perversion of human nature must run counter to nature's will? Well, you understand its will. So does this misfortune prevent you in any way from being just, generous, sober, reasonable, careful, free from error, courteous, free, etc. – all of which together make human nature complete? Remember from now on whenever something tends to make you unhappy, draw on this principle: 'This is no misfortune; but bearing with it bravely is a blessing. ' ", "We are responsible for some things, while there are others for which we cannot be held responsible. The former include our judgement, our impulse, our desire, aversion and our mental faculties in general; the latter include the body, material possessions, our reputation, status – in a word, anything not in our power to control. The former are naturally free, unconstrained and unimpeded, while the latter are frail, inferior, subject to restraint – and none of our affair. Remember that if you mistake what is naturally inferior for what is sovereign and free, and what is not your business for your own, you'll meet with disappointment, grief and worry and be at odds with God and man. But if you have the right idea about what really belongs to you and what does not, you will never be subject to force or hindrance, you will never blame or criticize anyone, and everything you do will be done willingly. You won't have a single rival, no one to hurt you, because you will be proof against harm of any kind. ", "With rewards this substantial, be aware that a casual effort is not sufficient. Other ambitions will have to be sacrificed, altogether or at least for now. If you want these rewards at the same time that you are striving for power and riches, chances are you will not get to be rich and powerful while you aim for the other goal; and the rewards of freedom and happiness will elude you altogether. ", "primarily: ask, 'Is this something that is, or is not, in my control?' And if it's not one of the things that you control, be ready with the reaction, 'Then it's none of my concern.'", "It is not events that disturb people, it is their judgements concerning them."
<br>
<br>
"For every challenge, remember the resources you have within you to cope with it.", ". In time, you will grow to be confident that there is not a single impression that you will not have the moral means to tolerate. "
<br>
<br>
"you are hurt the moment you believe yourself to be", "if a companion is dirty, his friends cannot help but get a little dirty too, no matter how clean they started out. ", "As with impressions generally, if you get an impression of something pleasurable, watch yourself so that you are not carried away by it. Take a minute and let the matter wait on you. Then reflect on both intervals of time: the time you will have to experience the pleasure, and the time after its enjoyment that you will beat yourself up over it. Contrast that with how happy and pleased you'll be if you abstain. If the chance to do the deed presents itself, take extra care that you are not overcome by its seductiveness, pleasure and allure. Counter temptation by remembering how much better will be the knowledge that you resisted. ", "If you decide to do something, don't shrink from being seen doing it, even if the majority of people disapprove. If you're wrong to do it, then you should shrink from doing it altogether; but if you're right, then why worry how people will judge you?", "Someone bathes in haste; don't say he bathes badly, but in haste. Someone drinks a lot of wine; don't say he drinks badly, but a lot. Until you know their reasons, how do you know that their actions are vicious? This will save you from perceiving one thing clearly, but then assenting to something different. ", "Never identify yourself as a philosopher or speak much to non-philosophers about your principles; act in line with those principles. At a dinner party, for instance, don't tell people the right way to eat, just eat the right way", "When your body gets used to simple living, don't preen over it; if you're a water drinker, don't take every opportunity to announce it. If you want to train for physical austerities, do it for yourself, not for outsiders."
<br>
<br>
"The first and most important field of philosophy is the application of principles such as 'Do not lie.' Next come the proofs, such as why we should not lie. The third field supports and articulates the proofs, by asking, for example, 'How does this prove it? What exactly is a proof, what is logical inference, what is contradiction, what is truth, what is falsehood?' Thus, the third field is necessary because of the second, and the second because of the first. The most important, though, the one that should occupy most of our time, is the first. But we do just the opposite. We are preoccupied with the third field and give that all our attention, passing the first by altogether. The result is that we lie – but have no difficulty proving why we shouldn't."
