<h2>My review of the TRUTHEAR GATE IEMs</h2>

<p>If you're looking for some good IEMs (in-ear monitors) that won't cost you too much, the Truthear GATE is a great option. At around Â£20 (~$27), it's hard not to be curious. But are they actually a good pair of IEMs or just a cheap piece of tech that won't deliver?
    <br>
    <h3>Overview</h3> 
    (Skip this if you don't care about all the technical stuff, I don't really understand most of it.)
    <br>
    The Truthear GATE is a single dynamic driver IEM featuring a 10mm carbon LCP diaphragm. With an impedance of 28Î© and sensitivity of 122dB, it's easy to drive straight from your phone or laptopâ€”no fancy DACs needed. The package includes a detachable 2-pin oxygen-free copper cable, multiple sets of silicone tips, and a faux-leather pouch (nice for taking them out).
    <br>
    <h3>The Positives</h3>
    1. Sound Quality
    <br>
    For its price, the GATE delivers quality sound. Before these I was using the Sony WH-1000XM5s and although the sound is noticeably not as good, for over 10x less, it gets pretty close.
    <br>
    <br>
    2. Comfortable Fit
    <br>
    Lightweight and ergonomically designed, the GATE sits comfortably in the ear, making it suitable for long listening sessions. The support that goes over  your ear allows the weight to be distributed comfortable and makes it so that the earphones don't feel like they're constantly trying to fall out of your ears. The included variety of ear tips helps in achieving a good seal for all users. 
    <br>
    <br>
    3. Looks
    <br>
    I really like the look of these. The design is transparent, letting you see the internals. The rest of the IEMs are black (or white if you choose that option) In the box you also get a nice leather pouch for safely storing the IEMs. I've found this useful when taking the IEMs out with me.
    <br>
    <br>
    4. Value for Money
    <br>
    At just Â£20 (~$27), the GATE offers sound quality and features that rival more expensive IEMs. I personally am not a seasoned IEM user, but compared to all of the sound devices I have used, these come in very near the top, especially for their price.
    <br>
    <h3>The Negatives</h3>
    Honestly, for the price, there really aren't any glaring negatives. Sure, the sound or build quality could be better. But, <strong>THEY'RE Â£20!</strong>, and for that price, they truly overdeliver.
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    Overall, the Truthear GATE is an <strong>excellent</strong> choice for a budget IEM with impressive sound quality. While it has its shortcomings in build and cable quality, the audio performance, price and looks more than compensate. Whether you're new to IEMs or looking for an affordable backup, the GATE is a very good choice that won't disappoint.
