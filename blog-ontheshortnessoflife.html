<p>Quotes and sections I liked from <i>On the Shortness of Life by Epictetus</i>
    <br>
    <br>
"We do not have a very short time assigned to us, but we lose a great deal of it: life is long enough to carry out the most important projects: we have an ample portion, if we do but arrange the whole of it aright: but when it all runs to waste through luxury and carelessness, when it is not devoted to any good purpose, then at the last we are forced to feel that it is all over, although we never noticed how it glided away."
<br>
<br>
"we do not receive a short life, but we make it a short one, and we are not poor in days, but wasteful of them."
<br>
<br>
"Life is long enough, if you know how to use it."
<br>
<br>
"We live a small part only of our lives."
<br>
<br>
"no one lays claim to his own self, everyone wastes his time over someone else."
<br>
<br>
"men will not allow anyone to establish himself upon their estates, and upon the most trifling dispute about the measuring of boundaries, they betake themselves to stones and cudgels; yet they allow others to encroach upon their lives, nay, they themselves actually lead others in to take possession of them. You cannot find anyone who wants to distribute his money; yet among how many people does everyone distribute his life?"
<br>
<br>
"people live as though they would live forever: you never remember your human frailty; you never notice how much of your time has already gone by: you spend it as though you had an abundant and overflowing store of it"
<br>
<br>
"are you not ashamed to reserve only the leavings of your life for yourself, and appoint for the enjoyment of your own right mind only that time which you cannot devote to any business?"
<br>
<br>
"What a foolish forgetfulness of our mortality, to put off wholesome counsels until our fiftieth or sixtieth year, and to choose that our lives shall begin at a point which few of us ever reach."
<br>
<br>
"for what can be greater than the man who is greater than Fortune?"
<br>
<br>
"Believe me, it requires a great man and one who is superior to human frailties not to allow any of his time to be filched from him: and therefore it follows that his life is a very long one, because he devotes every possible part of it to himself: no portion lies idle or uncultivated, or in another man's power; for he finds nothing worthy of being exchanged for his time, which he husbands most grudgingly. He, therefore, had time enough: whereas those who gave up a great part of their lives to the people of necessity had not enough"
<br>
<br>
"there is no such obstacle to true living as waiting, which loses today while it is depending on the morrow."
<br>
<br>
"Life is divided into three parts: that which has been, that which is, and that which is to come: of these three stages, that which we are passing through is brief, that which we are about to pass is uncertain, and that which we have passed is certain: this it is over which Fortune has lost her rights, and which can fall into no other man's power: and this is what busy men lose: for they have no leisure to look back upon the past, and even if they had, they take no pleasure in remembering what they regret: they are, therefore, unwilling to turn their minds to the contemplation of ill-spent time, and they shrink from reviewing a course of action whose faults become glaringly apparent when handled a second time, although they were snatched at when we were under the spell of immediate gratification."
<br>
<br>
"No one, unless all his acts have been submitted to the infallible censorship of his own conscience, willingly turns his thoughts back upon the past."
<br>
<br>
"those whose life is spent without any engrossing business may well find it ample: no part of it is made over to others, or scattered here and there; no part is entrusted to fortune, is lost by neglect, is spent in ostentatious giving, or is useless: all of it is, so to speak, invested at good interest. A very small amount of it, therefore, is abundantly sufficient, and so, when his last day arrives, the wise man will not hang back, but will walk with a steady step to meet death."
<br>
<br>
"we ought to give the name of luxury to unlearning the life and habits of a man"
<br>
<br>
"this vain longing to learn what is useless has taken hold" - TAKE ACTION
<br>
<br>
"The only persons who are really at leisure are those who devote themselves to philosophy"
<br>
<br>
"they lose the day in looking forward to the night, and lose the night through fear of the dawn."
<br>
<br>
"Such men's very pleasures are restless and disturbed by various alarms, and at the most joyous moment of all there rises the anxious thought: "How long will this last?" This frame of mind has led kings to weep over their power, and they have not been so much delighted at the grandeur of their position, as they have been terrified by the end to which it must some day come."
<br>
<br>
"Meanwhile they take no account of time, of which they will never have a fresh and larger supply"
<br>
<br>
"tear yourself away from the common herd"
<br>
<br>
"most unhappy of all is that of those who do not even labour at their own affairs, but have to regulate their rest by another man's sleep, their walk by another man's pace, and whose very love and hate, the freest things in the world, are at another's bidding. If such men wish to know how short their lives are, let them think how small a fraction of them is their own."
