<h2>Meditations</h2>

<p>Quotes and sections I liked from <i>Meditations by Marcus Aurelius</i>
    <br>
    (the reason they are formatted weirdly is that they are in paragraphs per day I took notes)
<br>
<br>
"all is as thinking makes it so", "All the actors in the play of history have, of course, dissapeared". (these are both actually not from the Meditations themselves)
"to have had good teachers... and to realise that this is the sort of thing on which one should spend lavishly.", "tolerate pain and feel few needs", "be deaf to malicious gossip",  "be always the same man, unchanged in sudden pain", "the acts of a man with an eye for precisely what needs to be done, not the glory of its doing' "
<br>
<br>
"Say to yourself first thing in the morning: today I shall meet people who are meddling, ungrateful, aggressive, treacherous, malicious, unsocial. All this has afflicted them through their ignorance of true good and evil. But I have that the nature of good is what is right, and the nature of evil what is wrong; and I reflected that the nature of the offender himself is akin to my own - not a kinship of blood or seed, but a sharing in the same mind, the same fragment of divinity. Therefore I cannot be harmed by any of them, as none will infect me with their wrong. Nor can I be angry with my kinsman or hate him. We were born for cooperation, like feet, like hands, like eyelids, like the rows of upper and lower teeth. So to work in opposition to one another is against nature: and anger or rejection is opposition." remeber this, "no more jerking to the strings of selfish impulse", "every hour of the day give vigorous attention... to perform the task at hand with precise analysis, with unnafected dignity, with human sympathy, with disspasionate justice - and to vacating your mind from all its other thoughts.", "you will achieve this vacation if you perform each action as if it were the last of your life", "You may leave this life at any moment: have this possibility in your mind in all that you do or say or think.",  "remember that no one loses any life other than the one he lives, or lives any life other than the one he loses.", "all is as thinking makes it so", "The soul of a man harms itself, first and foremost, when it becomes (as far as it can) a separate growth, a sort of tumour on the universe; because to resent anything that happens is to separate oneself in revolt from Nature, which holds in collective embrace the particular natures of all other things." (the full passage is on page 14-15), "life is warfare"
<br>
<br>
"do not waste the remaining part of your life in thoughts about other people", "your duty is to stand straight - not held straight", "no action should be undertaken without aim", "Men seek retreats for themselves - in the country, by the sea, in the hills - and you yourself are particularly prone to this yearning. But all this is quite unphilosophic, when it is open to you, at any time you want, to retreat into yourself. No retreat offers someone more quiet and relaxation than that into his own mind, especially if he can dip into thoughts there which put him at immediate and complete ease: and by ease I simply mean a well-ordered life. So constantly give yourself this retreat, and renew yourself. The doctrines you will visit there should be few and fundamental, sufficient at one meeting to wash away all your pain and send you back free of resentment at what you must rejoin.", "be your own master", "things cannot touch the mind: they are external and inert; anxieties can only come from your internal judgement", "Remove the judgement, and you have removed the thought 'I am hurt': remove the thought 'I am hurt', and the hurt itself is removed", "What does not make a human being worse in himself cannot make his life worse either", "All's right that happens in the world" remember this and examine it in your day to day life, "When someone does you wrong, do not judge things as he intreprets them or would like you to interpret them. Just see them as they are, in plain truth", "while you live, while you can, become good", "One who is all in a flutter over his subsequent fame fails to imagine that those who remember him will very soon be dead - and he to", "
"we should not be like children with their parents, simply accepting what we are told.", "Be like the rocky headland on which the waves constantly break. It stands firm", "'It is my bad luck that this has happened to me.' No, you should rather say: 'It is my good luck that, although this has happened to me, I can bear it without pain, neither crushed by the present nor fearful of the future.'"
<br>
<br>
"At break of day, when you are reluctant to get up, have this thought ready to mind: 'I am getting up for a man's work. Do I still then resent it, if I am going out to do what I was born for, the purpose for which I was brought into the world? Or was I created to wrap myself up in blankets and keep warm?' 'But this is more pleasant.' Were you then born for pleasure- all for feeling, not for action? Can you not see plants, birds, ants, spiders, bees all doing their own work, each helping in their own way to order the world? And then you do not want to do the work of a human being- you do not hurry to the demands of your own nature. 'But one needs rest too.' One does indeed: I agree. But nature has set limits on this too, just as it has to eating and drinking, and yet you go beyond these limits, beyond what you need. Not in your actions, though, not any longer: here you stay below your capability.", "Think of the whole existince, of which you are the tiniest part; think of the whole time, in which you have been assigned a brief and fleeting moment; think of destiny - what fraction of that are you?", "Another does wrong. What is that to me? Let himsee to it: he has his own disposition, his own action. I have now what universal nature wishes me to have now, and I do what my own nature wishes me to do now."
<br>
<br>
"your directiing mind must not of itself add any judgement of good or bad", "If you are doing your proper duty let it not matter to you whether you are cold or warm, whether you are sleepy or well-slept, whether men speak badly or well of you, even whether you are on the point of death or doing something else: because even this , the act in which we die, is one of the acts of life, and so here to it suffices to 'make the best move you can'.", "The best revenge is not to be like your enemy", "Disgraceful if, in this life where your body does not fail, your soul should fail you first", "
"Always as a pupil of Antonius..." pg 51-52, "Pain of labor for hand or foot is not contrary to nature, as long as the foot is doing the work of a foot and the hand the work of a hand. So likewise a man, qua man, there is nothing contrary to nature in pain, as long as he is doing the work of a man: and if not contrary to nature for him, nor an evil either", "What does not benefit the hive does not benefit the bee either"
<br>
<br>
"Bear in mind that a person's worth is measured by the worth of what he values", "Is someone afraid of change?  Well, what can ever come to be without change? Or what is dearer or closer to the nature of the Whole than change? Can you yourself take your bath, if the wood that heats it is not changed? Can you be fed , unless what you eat changes? Can any other benefits of life be achieved without change? Do you not see then that for you to be changed is equal, and equally necessary to the nature of the Whole?", "Do not dream of possession of what you do not have: rather reflect on the greatest blessings in what you do have, and on their account remind yourself how much they would have been missed if they were not there. But at the same time you must be careful not to let your pleasure in them habituate you to dependancy, to avoid disstress if they are sometimes absent", "Imagine you were now dead, or had not lived before this moment. Now view the rest of your life as a bonus, and live it as nature directs", "'No soul', says Plato, 'Likes to be robbed of truth' - and the same holds of justice, moderation, kindness, and all such virtues. Essential that you should keep this constantly in your mind: this will make you more gentle to all", "In most casesof pain you should be helped too by the saying of Epicurus: 'Pain is neither unendurable nor undending, as long as you remember its limits and do not exaggerate it in your imagination.' Remember too that many things we find dissagreable are unrecognised analogues of pain - drowsiness, for example, oppresive heat, loss of appetite, So when you find yourself complaining of any of these, say to yourself, 'You are giving in to pain'."
<br>
<br>
"the happy life depends of very little", "Perfection of character is this: to life each day as if it were your last, without frenzy, without apathy, without pretence", "The work of the universal nature is to translate this reality to another, to change things, to take them from here and carry them there. All things are mutations, but there is equality too in their distribution. All is familiar: no cause then for fear of anthing new", "regret is a censure of yourself for missing something beneficial. The good must be something beneficial, and of concern to the wholly good person. No wholly good person would regret missing a pleasure. Therefore pleasure is neither beneficial nor a good", "When you are reluctant to get up from sleep, remind yourself that it is your consittution and man's nature to perform social acts, whereas sleep is something you share with dumb animals. Now what accords with the nature of each bein is thereby the more closely related to it, the more in its essence and indeed the more to its liking", "Constantyl test your mental impressions - each one individually, if you can: investigate the cause, identify the emotion, apply the analysis of logic", "Whenever you meet someone, ask yourself first this immediate question: 'What beliefs does this person hold about the good and bad in life?' Because if he believes this or that about pleasure and pain and their constituents, about fame and obscurity, death and life, then I shall not find it surprising or strange if he acts in this or that way, and I shall remember that he has no choice but to act as he does", "Nothing should be done without purpose", "Man's joy is to do man's proper work", "When you speak... to any individual, be straight forward, not pedantic. Use language which rings true", "Accept humbly: let go easily"
<br>
<br>
"In the constitution of the rational being I can see no virtue that counters justice: but I do see the counter to pleasure - self-control", "If you remove your judgement from anything that seems painful, you yourself stand quite immune to pain. 'What self?' Reason. 'But I am not just reason.' Granted. So let your reason cause itself no pain, and if some other part of you is in trouble, it can form its own judgement for itself", "They kill, they cut in pieces, they hunt with curses.' What relevance has this to keeping your mind pure, sane, sober, just? As if a man were to come up to a spring of clear, sweet water and curse it- it would still continue to bubble up water good to drink. He could throw in mud or dung: in no time the spring will break it down, wash it away, and take no colour from it. How then can you secure an everlasting spring and not a cistern? By keeping yourself at all times intent on freedom- and staying kind, simple and decent."
<br>
<br>
"You should leave another's wrong where it lies", "Reflect that neither memory, nor fame, nor anything else at all, has any importance worth thinking of"
<br>
<br>
"Loss is nothing more than change", "If he did wrong, the harm is to himself", "And what harm have you suffered? You will find that none of these who excite your anger has done anything capable of affecting your mind forthe worse: and it is only in your mind that damage or harm can be done to you - they have no other existence", "All that happens is an event either within your natural ability to bear it, or not. So if it is an event within that ability, do not complain, but bear it as you were born to. If outside that ability, do not complain either: it will take you away before you have the chance for complaint. Remember, though, that you are by your own nature born to bear all that your judgement can decide bearable, or tolerate in action, if you  represent it to yourself as benefit or duty", "If he has failed to see wrong, teach him kindly and show him what he has failed to see. If you can't do that, blame yourself - or perhaps not even yourself"
<br>
<br>
"Adopt a systematic study of the way things change into one another: pay constant attention to this aspect of nature and train yourself in it. Nothing is so conducive to greatness of mind. One so trained has divested himself of his body: recognising that in almost no time he will have to leave all this behind and depart from the world of men, he has devoted his entire self to justice in his own actions and to the nature of the Whole in all things external. He does not even give a thought to what others will say or suppose about him, or do against him, but is content to meet these two conditions - his own integrity in each present action, and glad acceptance of his present lot. He has abandoned all other preoccupations and ambitions, and his only desire is to walk the straight path according to law", "No more roundabout discussions of what makes a good man. Be one!"
<br>
<br>
"Someone despises me? That is his concern. But I will see to it that I am not found guilt of any word or action deserving contempt. Will he hate me? That is his concern. But I will be kind and well-intentioned to all, and ready to show this very person what he is failing to see - not in any criticism or display of tolerance, but with genuine good will"
<br>
<br>
"It is not their actions which trouble us - because these lie in their own directing minds - but our judgements, make up your mind to dismiss your assessment of some supposed outrage, and your anger is gone. And how to remove them? By reflecting that no moral harm is caused you. If moral harm were not the only true harm, it would necessarily follow that you yourself are guilt of causing much harm, and become a robber, a rogue!", "It is the gentle who have strength, sinew and courage - not the indignant and complaining. The closer to control of emotion, the closer to power", "The man without one and the same aim in life cannot himself stay one and the same throughout his life", "'No thief can steal your will' - so Epictetus", "See things for what they are, analysing into material, cause and reference", "If it is not right, don't do it: if it is not true, don't say it", "That all is as thinking makes it so - and you can control your thinking. So remove judgements whenever you wosh and then there is calm - as the sailor rounding the cape finds smooth water and the welcome of a waveless bay"
