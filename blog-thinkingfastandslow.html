<h2>Thinking, Fast and Slow</h2>

<p>Quotes and sections I liked from <i>Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman</i>
<br>
<br>
"We are often confident even when we are wrong, and an objective observer is more likely to detect our errors than we are."
<br>
<br>
"My intuitive impression could be due entirely to journalist's choices of topics and to my reliance on the availability heuristic"
<br>
<br>
"our excessive confidence in what we know, and our apparent inability to acknowledge the full extent of our ignorance and the uncertainty of the world we live in. We are prone to overestimate how much we understand about the world and underestimate the role of chance in events. Overconfidence is fed by the illusory certainty of hindsight."
<br>
<br>
"we can be blind to the obvious, and we are also blind to our blindness"
<br>
<br>
"One of the significant discoveries of cognitive psychologists in recent decades is that switching from one task to another is effortful, especially under time pressure" -> FOCUS, do one thing at a time
<br>
<br>
"People who are cognitively busy are more likely to make selfish choices, use sexist language, and make superficial judgements in social situations."
<br>
<br>
"Another major advance in our understanding of memory was the discovery that priming is not restricted to concepts and words."
<br>
<br>
The Florida effect
<br>
<br>
"the common admonition to "act kind and calm regardless of how you feel" is very good advice: you are likely to be rewarded by actually feeling calm and kind"
<br>
<br>
"a purely symbolic reminder of being watched prodded people into improved behaviour."
<br>
<br>
cognitive ease
<br>
<br>
"People who are repeatedly exposed to the phrase "the body temperature of a chicken" were more likely to accept the statement that "the body temperature of a chicken is 144 degrees" (or any other arbitrary number). The familiarity of one phrase in the statement sufficed to make the whole statement feel familiar, and therefore true." -> use in business, specifically copywriting
<br>
<br>
"Compare these two statements:
<br>
<br>
<b>Adolf Hitler was born in 1892</b>
<br>
Adolf Hitler was born in 1887
<br>
<br>
Both are false (Hitler was born in 1889), but experiments have shown that the first is more likely to be believed."
<br>
<br>
"if your message is to be printed use high quality paper to maximise contrast", "If you use colour, you are more likely to be believed if your text is printed in bright blue or red than in middling shades of green, yellow or pale blue.", "If you care about being thought credible and intelligent, do not use complex language where simpler language will do"
<br>
<br>
"In addition to making your message simple, try to make it memorable.", "Participants in a much cited experiment read dozens of unfamiliar aphorisms... The aphorisms were judged more insightful when they rhymed than when they did not."
<br>
<br>
"if you quote a source, choose one with a name that is easy to pronounce."
<br>
<br>
"If possible, the recipients of your message want to stay away from anything that reminds them of effort, including a source with a complicated name."
<br>
<br>
"The experimenters recruited 40 Princeton students to take the CRT. Half of them saw the puzzles in a small font in washed-out grey print. The puzzles were legible, but the font induced cognitive strain. The results tell a clear story: 90% of the students who saw the CRT in normal font made at least on mistake in the test, but the proportion dropped to 35% when the font was barely legible... Cognitive strain, whatever its source, mobilizes System 2, which is more likely to reject the intuitive answer suggested by System 1."
<br>
<br>
"cognitive ease is associated with good feelings"
<br>
<br>
"companies with pronounceable names do better than others for the first week after the stock is issued, though the effect disappears over time.", "Stocks with pronounceable trading symbols (like KAR or LUNMOO) outperform those with tongue-twisting tickers like PXG or RD--and they appear to retain a small advantage over some time."
<br>
<br>
<i>The mere exposure effect</i> - "the words that were presented more frequently were rated much more favourably than the words that had been shown only once or twice.", this effect can also be seen in nature -> animal sees novel stimulus = fear, over time if nothing bad happens that specific stimulus = safe, safe = good.
<br>
<br>
"We are evidently ready at birth to have *impressions* of causality, which do not depend on reasoning about patterns of causation. They are products of System 1."
<br>
<br>
"The operations of associative memory contribute to a general <i>confirmation bias</i> ... A deliberate search for confirming evidence, know as <i>positive test strategy</i>, is how System 2 tests a hypothesis... people (and scientists, quite often) seek data that are likely to be compatible with the beliefs they currently hold."
<br>
<br>
"The tendency to like (or dislike) everything about a person--including things you have not observed-is known as the <i>halo effect</i>."
<br>
<br>
"The initial traits in the list change the very meaning of the traits that appear later" -> Solomon Asch personality trait study.
<br>
<br>
"the halo effect increases the weight of first impressions."
<br>
<br>
"To derive the most useful information from multiple sources of evidence, you should always make sure that the sources are independent of each other."
<br>
<br>
"The standard practice of open discussion gives too much weight to the opinions of those who speak early and assertively, causing others to line up behind."
<br>
<br>
"<i>WYSIATI</i>", "what you see is all there is"
<br>
<br>
"Framing effects", "different ways of presenting the same information often evoke different emotions.", "the odds of survival one month after surgery are 90%", "mortality within one month of the surgery is 10%"
<br>
<br>
"There is no limit to the number of questions you can answer, whether they are questions someone else asks or questions you ask yourself."
<br>
<br>
Alex Todorov political faces rated on likeability, competence, etc "In 70% of the race for senator, congressman, and governor, the election winner was the candidate who's face had earned a higher rating of competence.", "people judge competence by combining the two dimensions of strength and trustworthiness"
<br>
<br>
"Different groups of participants stated their willingness to pay to save 2,000, 20,000, or 200,000 birds... the average contributions of these three groups were $80, $78and $88 respectively... The almost complete neglect of quantity in such emotional contexts has been confirmed many times."
<br>
<br>
"the mode of prediction by matching is statistically wrong"
<br>
<br>
"The technical definition of heuristic is a simple procedure that helps find adequate, though often imperfect, answers to difficult questions."
<br>
<br>
"System 1 often makes this move when faced with difficult target questions, if the answer to a related and easier heuristic question comes readily to mind."
<br>
<br>
"The mental shotgun makes it easy to generate quick answers to difficult questions without imposing much hard work on your lazy System 2."
<br>
<br>
"The present state of mind looms very large when people evaluate their happiness."
<br>
<br>
"The psychologist Paul Slovic has proposed an *affect heuristic* in which people let their likes and dislikes determine their beliefs about the world."
<br>
<br>
System 1 "generates impressions, feelings, and inclinations; when endorsed by System 2 these become beliefs, attitudes, and intentions."
<br>
<br>
"extreme outcomes (both high and low) are more likely to be found in small than in large samples."
<br>
<br>
"Can you're System 1 distinguish between degrees of belief? The principle of WYSIATI suggests that it cannot."
<br>
<br>
"The truth is that small school are not better on average; they are simply more variable."
<br>
<br>
"an <i>anchoring effect</i>... occurs when people consider a particular value for an unknown quantity before estimating that quantity", "if you were asked whether Gandhi was more than 114 years old when he died you will end up with a much higher estimate of his age of death than if the anchoring question referred to death at 35."
<br>
<br>
"people who are instructed to shake their head when they hear the anchor, as if they rejected it, move farther from the anchor, and people who nod their head show enhanced anchoring."
<br>
<br>
"Insufficient adjustment is a failure of a weak or lazy System 2."
<br>
<br>
"My hunch was that anchoring was a case of suggestion. This is the word we use when someone causes us to hear, see, or feel something by merely bringing it to mind. For example, the question 'Do you feel a slight numbness in your left leg?' always prompts quite a few people to report that their left leg does indeed feel a little strange."
<br>
<br>
"the role of <i>associative coherence</i> in anchoring.", "In one experiment, they asked an anchoring question about temperature: 'Is the annual mean temperature in Germany higher or lower than 20C (68F)?' Or, 'Is the annual mean temperature in Germany higher or lower than 5C (41F)?' All participants were the briefly shown words that they were asked to identify. The researchers found that 68F made it easier to recognise summer words (like *sun* and *beach*), and 40F facilitated winter words (like *frost* and *ski*)... the high and low numbers activate different sets of ideas in memory."
<br>
<br>
<i>the anchoring index</i>: "Is the heigh of the tallest redwood more or less than 1,200 feet?", "What is your best guess about the height of the tallest redwood?", "For other participants, the first question referred to a 'low anchor' of 180 feet", "The difference between the two anchors was 1,020 feet", "As expected, the two groups produced very different mean estimates: 844 and 282 feet", "the anchoring index ratio is simply the ratio of the two differences (562/1,020), expressed as a percentage: 55%", "The value observed of 55% in this experiment is typical."
<br>
<br>
"Powerful anchoring effects are found in decisions that people make about money.", e.g. the real estate agent house valuation example with high and low price anchors, 41% anchoring, AND said they weren't influenced by the price shown
<br>
<br>
"a key finding in anchoring research is that anchors that are obviously random can be just as effective as potentially informative anchors. When we used a wheel of fortune to anchor estimates of the proportion of African nations in the UN, the anchoring index was 44%, well within the range of effects observed with anchors that could plausibly be taken as hints."
<br>
<br>
German judges said they would sentence someone to a different number of months in jail when they were anchored to a weighted die roll of either 9 or 3. The anchoring effect was 50%.
<br>
<br>
"supermarket shoppers is Sioux City, Iowa, encountered a sales promotion for Campbells soup at about 10% off the regular price. On some days a sign on the shelf said <i>limit of 12 per person</i>. On other days, the sign said *no limit per person*. Shoppers purchased an average of 7 cans when the limit was in force, twice as many as when the limit was removed. Anchoring is not the sole explanation. Rationing also implies that the goods are flying off the shelves, and shoppers should feel some urgency about stocking up."
<br>
<br>
"The participants who have been exposed to random or absurd anchors (such as Gandhi's death at 144) confidently deny that this obviously useless information could have influenced their estimate, and they are wrong."
<br>
<br>
"you should assume that any number that is on the table has had an anchoring effect on you, and if the stakes are high you should mobilize yourself (your System 2) to combat the effect."
<br>
<br>
"We defined <i>the availability heuristic</i> as the process of judging frequency by 'the ease at which instances come to mind'."
<br>
<br>
"The availability heuristic, like other heuristics of judgement, substitutes one question for another: you wish to estimate the size of a category or the frequency of the event, but you report am impression of the ease with which instances come to mind."
<br>
<br>
"One of the best-known studies of availability suggests that awareness of your own biases can contribute to peace in marriages, and probably in other joint projects."
<br>
<br>
"The same bias contributes to the common observation that many members of a collaborative team feel they have done more than their share and also feel that the others are not adequately grateful for the individual contributions."
<br>
<br>
"The experience of fluent retrieval of instances trumped the number retrieved.", how easy it is to retrieve items has more effect on the bias that how many items you retrieved 
<br>
<br>
"A professor at UCLA found a group of ingenious ways to exploit the availability bias. He asked different groups of students to list ways to improve the course, and he varied the required number of improvements. As expected, students who listed more ways to improve the class rated it higher."
<br>
<br>
"The proof that you truly understand a pattern of behaviour is that you know how to reverse it."
<br>
<br>
"It is the unexpectedly low fluency that causes people who were asked for twelve instances to describe themselves as unassertive. When the surprise is eliminated, low fluency no longer influences the judgement."
<br>
<br>
"The lesson is clear: estimates of causes of death are warped by media coverage. The coverage is itself biased toward novelty and poignancy, The media do not just shape what the public is interested in, but also are shaped by it."
<br>
<br>
"Slovic eventually developed the notion of an affect heuristic, in which people make judgementss and decision by consulting their emotions: Do I like it? Do I hate it? How strongly do I feel about it? In many domains of life, Slovic said, people form opinions and make choices that directly express their feelings and their basic tendency to approach or avoid, often without knowing that they are doing so. The affect heuristic is an instance of substitution, in which the answer to an easy question (How do I feel about it?) serves as an answer to a much harder question (What do I think about it?)."
<br>
<br>
"the striking finding was that people who had received a message extolling the benefits of a technology also changed their beliefs about its risks. Although they had received no relevant evidence, the technology they now liked more than before was also perceived as less risky. Similarly, respondents who were told only that the risk of a technology were mild developed a more favourable view of its benefits."
<br>
<br>
the Alar incident or Alar scare of 1989 "Alar is a chemical sprayed on apples... scare began with press stories that the chemical, when consumed in gigantic doses, caused tumours in rats and mice... The apple industry sustained large losses... Subsequent research confirmed that the substance might pose a very small risk as a possible carcinogen, but the Alar incident was certainly an enormous overreaction to a minor problem. The net effect of the incident on public health was probably detrimental because fewer good apples were consumed.", "The Alar incident illustrates a basic limitation in the ability of our mind to deal with small risks: we either ignore them altogether or give them far too much weight -- nothing in between."
<br>
<br>
"Availability cascades are real and they undoubtedly distort priorities in the allocation of public resources."
<br>
<br>
"if you must guess whether a woman who is described as 'a shy poetry lover' studies Chinese literature or business administration, you should opt for the latter option. Even if every female student of Chinese literature is shy and loves poetry, it is almost certain that there are more bashful poetry lovers in the much larger population of business students."
<br>
<br>
"worthless information should not be treated differently from a complete lack of information"
<br>
<br>
<i>Bayesian statistics</i> "This influential modern approach to statistics is named after an English minister pf the eighteenth century, the Reverend Thomas Bayes, who is credited with the first major contribution to a large problem: the logic of how people should change their mind in the light of evidence. Bayes's rule specifies how prior beliefs (in the examples of this chapter, base rates) should be combined with the diagnostic of the evidence, the degree to which it favours the hypothesis over the alternative."
<br>
<br>
"When the evidence is weak, one should stick with the base rates."
<br>
<br>
<i>the Linda problem</i> "Think in terms of Venn diagrams. The set of feminist bank tellers in wholly included in the set of bank tellers, as every feminist bank teller is a bank teller. therefore, the probability that Linda is a feminist bank teller *must* be lower than the probability of her being a bank teller."
<br>
<br>
"The uncritical substitution of plausibility for probability has pernicious effects on judgement when scenarios are used as tools for forecasting. Consider these two scenarios, which were presented to different groups,, with a request to evaluate their probability.", "A massive flood somewhere in North America next year, in which more than 1,000 people drown.", "An earthquake in California sometime next year, causing a flood in which more than 1,000 people drown.", "The California earthquake scenario is more plausible than the North America scenario, although its probability is certainly smaller.", "This is a trap for forecasters and their clients: adding detail to scenarios makes them more persuasive, but less likely to come true."

"an important principle of skill training: rewards for improved performance work better than punishment of mistakes", regression from the mean, do unusually bad = punish, do unusually good = reward BUT these are unusual results, the bad + punish will then (usually) become a more normal result (closer to the mean) and the good + reward will then also (usually) become a more normal result (closer to the mean). It seems like punish = improve and reward = get worse, but this isn't usually the case.
<br>
<br>
"Highly intelligent women tend to marry men who are less intelligent than they are." - it is just due to regression towards the mean, the chance of someone of high intelligence marrying someone else of high intelligence is lower than the chance of someone with high intelligence marrying someone with average intelligence.

"Depressed children treated with an energy drink will improve significantly over a three-month period", "It is also the case that depressed children who spend some time standing on their head or hug a cat for twenty minutes a day will also show improvement.", "Depressed children are an extreme group... and extreme groups regress to the mean over time.", "depressed children will get somewhat better over time even if they hug no cats and drink no Red Bull."

Max Bazerman's <i>Judgment in Managerial Decision Making</i>, if total sales go up by 10% over a year, you infer each locations sales will go up by around 10%, this is wrong, the lower sale locations will increase by more and the higher sale locations will increase by less or even decrease, this is due to regression to the mean.

"intuitive predictions tend to be overconfident and overly extreme."
<br>
<br>
"In <i>The Black Swan</i>, Taleb introduced the notion of a [[narrative fallacy]] to describe how flawed stories of the past shape our views of the world and out expectations of the future. Narrative fallacies arise inevitably from our continuous attempt to make sense of the world."
<br>
<br>
"Our comforting that the world makes sense rest on a secure foundation: our almost unlimited ability to ignore our ignorance."
<br>
<br>
See page 201 for how we misuse the word "know", when, in reality, we did not <i>know</i> something was going to happen.
<br>
<br>
"If an event had actually occurred, people exaggerated the probability that they had assigned to it earlier. If the possible event had not come to pass, the participants erroneously recalled that they had always considered it unlikely." Reminds me of the [[Steve Jobs]] quote, "You can only connect the dots looking backwards."
<br>
<br>
"Hindsight bias has pernicious effects on the evaluations of decision makers. It leads observers to assess the quality of a decision not by whether the process was sound but by whether its outcome was good or bad."
<br>

"To determine whether those ideas were well founded, Odean compared the returns of the stock the investor had sold and the stock he had bought in its place, over the course of one year after the transaction. The results were unequivocally bad. On average, the shares that individual traders sold did better than those they bought, by a very substantial margin: 3.2 percentage points per year, above and beyond the significant costs of executing the two trades."
<br>
<br>
"In a paper titled 'Trading is Hazardous to Your Wealth' they showed that, on average, the most active traders had the poorest results, while the investors who traded the least earned the highest returns."
<br>
<br>
"The illusion that we understand the past fosters overconfidence in our ability to predict the future."
<br>
<br>
"In the slim volume that he later called 'my disturbing little book', Meehl review the results of 20 studies that had analysed whether *clinical predictions* based on the subjective impressions of training professionals were more accurate than *statistical* prediction's made by combining a few scores or ratings according to a rule. In a typical study, training councelors predicted the grades of freshmen at the end of the school year. They also had access to high school grades, several aptitude tests, and a four-page personal statement. The statistical algorithm used only a fraction of this information: high school grades and one aptitude test. Nevertheless, the formula was more accurate than 11 of the 14 counselors."
<br>
<br>
"According to Meehl, there are a few circumstances under which it is a good idea to substitute judgement for a formula."
<br>
<br>
page 224-224: people contradict their own judgements (e.g. chest X-ray judgements made by specialists contradict themselves 20% of the time.)

"The surprising success of equal-weighted schemes has an important practical implication: it is possible to develop useful algorithms without and prior statistical research. Simple equally weighted formulas based on existing statistics or on common sense are often good predictors of significant outcomes."
<br>
<br>
the recognition-primed decision (RPD) model: "In the first phase, a tentative plan comes to mind by an automatic function of associative memory--System 1. The next phase is a deliberate process in which the plan is mentally simulated to check if it will work--an operation of System 2."

"Studies of chess masters have shown that at least 10,000 hours of dedicated practice (about 6 years of playing chess 5 hours a day) are required to attain the highest levels of performance" -> apply to business and other areas of my life
<br>
<br>
"There are many ways for any plan to fail, and although most of them are too improbable to be anticipated, the likelihood that <i>something</i> will go wrong in a big project is high."
<br>
<br>
"The prevalent tendency to underweight or ignore distributional information is perhaps the major source of error in forecasting. Planners should therefore make every effort to frame the forecasting problem so as to facilitate utilizing all the distributional information that is available.", "This may be considered the single most important piece of advice regarding how to increase accuracy in forecasting through improved methods."
<br>
<br>
"Organizations that take the word of overconfident experts can expect costly consequences."
<br>
<br>
<i>The Premortem</i>: "The procedure is simple: when the organization has almost come to an important decision but has not formally committed itself, Klein proposes gathering for a brief session a group of individuals who are knowledgeable about the decision. The premise of the session is a short speech: 'Imagine that we are a year into the future. We implemented the plan as it now exists. The outcome is a disaster. Please take 5 to 10 minutes to write a brief history of that disaster'.", "The premortem has two main advantages: it overcomes the groupthink that affects many teams once a decision appears to have been made, and it unleashes the imagination of knowledgeable individuals in a much needed direction."
<br>
<br>
"His utility function explained why poor people buy insurance and why richer people sell it to them. As you can see in the table, the loss of 1 million causes a loss of 4 points of utility (from 100 to 96) to someone who has 10 million and a much larger loss of 18 points (from 48 to 30) to someone who starts off with 3 million. The poorer man will happily pay a premium to transfer the risk to the richer one, which is what insurance is about."
<br>
<br>
"The third principle is loss aversion. When directly compared or weighed against each other, losses loom larger than gains. This asymmetry between the power of positive and negative expectations or experiences has an evolutionary history. Organisms that treat threats as more urgent than opportunities have a better chance to survive and reproduce."
<br>
<br>
"You can measure the extent of your aversion to losses by asking yourself a question: What is the smallest gain that I need to balance an equal chance to lose $100? For many people the answer is about $200, twice as much as the loss. The 'loss aversion ratio' has been estimated in several experiments and is usually in the range of 1.5 to 2.5."
<br>
<br>
"the power that the reference point exerts on choices": if two of exactly the same people are given the choice of a raise or more days leave (of the same value = indifferent), and we assume person 1 gets the raise and 2 the leave, even though the options are indifferent, at a later date if given the option to switch, they will be more likely to stay with their original choice, this is because we view losses as more impactful than gains, the loss of what you currently have or will lose by switching outweighs what you have to gain even if they are of equal value.
<br>
<br>
"The mugs experiment has remained the standard demonstration of the endowment effect, along with an even simpler experiment that Jack Knetsch reported at about the same time. Knetsch asked two classes to fill out a questionnaire and rewarded them with a gift that remained in front of them for the duration of the experiment. In one session, the prize was an expensive pen; in another, a bar of Swiss chocolate. At the end of the class, the experimenter showed the alternative gift and allowed everyone to trade his or her gift or another. Only about 10% of the participants opted to exchange their gift. Most of those who had received the pen stayed with the pen, and those who had received the chocolate did not budge either."
<br>
<br>
"In an exact replication of Jack Knetch's earlier experiment, List found that only 18% of the inexperienced traders were willing to exchange their gift for the other. In sharp contrast, experienced traders showed no trace of an endowment effect: 48% of them traded! At least in a market environment in which trading was the norm, they showed no reluctance to trade."
<br>
<br>
"The psychologist Paul Rozin, an expert on disgust, observed that a single cockroach will completely wreck the appeal of a bowl of cherries, but a cherry will do nothing for a bowl of cockroaches. As he points out, the negative trumps the positive in many ways, and loss aversion is one of many manifests of a broad negativity dominance."
<br>
<br>
"The self is motivated more to avoid bad self-definitions than to pursue good ones." This reminds me of the [[Sam Ovens]] quote "We are not the highest version of ourself which we can imagine, but the lowest version of ourselves which we can accept."

"long-term success of a relationship depends far more on avoiding the negative than on seeking the positive."

page 302 biology example: imaging you're out on a cold, extremely rainy, windy night.

"Animals, including people, fight harder to prevent losses than to achieve gains."
<br>
<br>
"we studied public perceptions of what constitutes unfair behaviour on the part of merchants, employers, and landlords. Our overarching question was whether the opprobrium attached to unfairness imposes contracts on profit seeking. We found that it does. We also found that the moral riles by which the public evaluates what firms may or may not do draw a crucial distinction between losses and gains. The basic principle is that existing wage, price, or rent sets a reference point, which has the nature of an entitlement that must not be infringed. It is considered unfair for the firm to impose losses on its customers or workers relative to the reference transaction, unless it most do so to protect its own entitlement."
<br>
<br>
"People who learned from a new catalogue that the merchant was now charging less for a product that they had recently bought a t a higher price deduced their future purchases from that supplier by 15%, an average loss of $90 per customer. the customers evidently perceived the lower price as the reference point and thought of themselves as having sustained a loss by paying more than apporpriate. Moreover, the customers who reacted the most strongly were those who bought more utems and at higher prices. The losses far exceeded the gains from the increased purchases produced by the lower prices in the new catalog."
<br>
<br>
*the possibility effect* AND *the certainty effect* (page 311-322 for all info on the topic & similar)
<br>
<br>
"Because of the possibility effect, we tend to overweight small risks and are willing to pay far more than expected value to eliminate them altogether. The psychological difference between a 95% risk of disaster and the certainty of disaster appears to be even greater; the sliver of hope that everything could still be okay looms very large. Overweighting of small probabilities increases the attractiveness of both gambles and insurance policies."
<br>
<br>
<i>The fourfold pattern</i> (pages 316-319)
<br>
<br>
"People overestimate the probability of unlikely events", "people overweight unlikely events in their decisions", "You do not always focus on the event you are asked to estimate. If the target event is very likely, you focus on its alternative"
<br>
<br>
"The probability of a rare event is most likely to be overestimated when the alternative is not fully specified" (examples start page 325)
<br>

In a study done on estimating rare events, participants estimated the probability of each of the top 8 teams in the NBA winning the playoffs, the total probabilities added to 240% on average.

<i>vivid probabilities</i>: "Participants in a well-known experiment are given a choice of drawing a marble from one of two urns, in which red marbles win a prize:
<br>
<br>
Urn A contains 10 marbles, of which 1 is red.
<br>
Urn B contains 100 marbles, of which 8 are red.
<br>

"To appreciate the link of regret to normailty, consider the following scenario:
<br>
<br>
Mr. Brown almost never picks up hitchhikers. Yesterday he gave a man a ride and was robbed.
<br>
<br>
Mr. Smith frequently picks up hitchhikers. Yesterday he gave a man a ride and was robbed.
<br>
<br>
Who of the two will experience greater regret over the episode?
<br>
<br>
The results are not surprising: 88% of respondents said Mr. Brown, 12% said Mr. Smith.
<br>
Regret is not the same as blame. Other participants were asked this question about the same incident.
<br>
<br>
Who will be criticized most severely by others?
<br>
<br>
The results: Mr. Brown 23%, Mr. Smith 77%.
<br>
Regret and blame are both evoked by a comparison to a norm, but the relevant norms are different. The emotions experienced by Mr. Brown and Mr. Smith are dominated by what they usually do about hitchhikers. Taking a hitchhiker is an abnormal event for Mr. Brown, and most people therefore expect him to experience more intense regret. A judgemental observer, however, will compare both men to conventional norms of reasonable behaviour and is likely to blame Mr. Smith for habitually taking unreasonable risks. We are tempted to say that Mr. Smith deserved his fate and that Mr. Brown was unlucky. But Mr. Brown is the one who is more likely to be kicking himself because he acted out of character in this one instance."

"people expect to have stronger emotional reactions (including regret) to an outcome that is produced by action than to the same outcome when it is produced by inaction.", examples on page 347-348
<br>
<br>
You are more likely to regret something when you were responsible for it than if you had no control even if the outcome is the same. Example page 349-350

"Almost everyone who sees both scenarios (within-subject) endorses the principle that poignancy is not a legitimate consideration. Unfortunately, the principle becomes relevant only when the two scenarios are seen together, and this is not how life usually works.", more explanation page 354

"The two descriptions of the short term outcomes of surgery were:
<br>
<br>
The one-month survival rate is 90%
There is 10% mortality in the first month.
<br>
<br>
...surgery was much more popular in the former frame(84% of physicians chose it) than in the latter (where 50% favoured radiation). The logical equivalence of the two descriptions is transparent, and a reality-bound decision maker would make the same choice regardless of which version she saw. But System 1, as we have gotten to know it, is rarely indifferent to emotional words: mortality is bad, survival is good, and 90% survival sounds encouraging whereas 10% mortality is frightening." full example page 367 (more examples after)
<br>
<br>
There are also "good frames" (page 371)
<br>
<br>
"Like other people, these professionals were susceptible to the framing effects. It is somewhat worrying that the officials who make decisions that affect everyone's health can be swayed by such a superficial manipulation--but we must get used to the idea that even important decisions are influenced, if not governed, by System 1."

"The statistical analysis revealed two findings, which illustrate a pattern we have observed in other experiments.
<br>
<br>
- Peak-end rule: The global retrospective rating was well predicted by the average of the level of pain reported at the worst moment of the experience and at its end.
<br>
- Duration neglect: The duration of the procedure had no effect whatsoever on the rating of total pain." (page 380)
<br>

"Memories are all we get to keep from our experience of living, and the only perspective that we can adopt as we think about our lives is therefore that of the remembering self."

"Can money buy happiness? The conclusion is that being poor makes one miserable, and that being rich may enhance one's life satisfaction, but not (on average) improve experienced well-being." (page 396)

"The easiest way to increase happiness is to control your use of time. Can you find more time to do the things you enjoy doing?"

"The answers to many simple questions can be substituted for a global evaluation of life.", "the score that you quickly assign to your life is determined by a small sample of highly available ideas, not by a careful weighting of the domains of your life." (page 399-400)

"This is the essence of the *focusing illusion*, which can be described in a single sentence:
<br>
<br>
<i>Nothing in life is as important as you think it is when you are thinking about it.</i>"
<br>
<br>
"The focusing illusion creates a bias in favour of goods and experiences that are initially exciting, even if they will eventually lose their appeal. Time is neglected, causing experiences that will retain their attention value in the long term to be appreciated less than they deserve to be." (more on page 406)
<br>
<br>
"The mind is good with stories, but it does not appear to be well designed for the processing of time."
<br>
<br>
"The central fact of our existence in that time is the ultimate finite resource, but the remembering self ignores that reality. The neglect of duration combined with the peak-end rule causes a bias that favours a short period of intense joy over a long period of moderate happiness. The mirror image of this bias makes us fear a short period of intense but tolerable pain more than we fear a much longer period of moderate pain. Duration neglect also makes us prone to accept a long period of mild unpleasantness because the end will be better, and it favours giving up an opportunity for a long happy period if it is likely to have a poor ending."
<br>
<br>
"The default option is naturally perceived as the normal choice. Deviating from the normal choice is an act of commission, which requires more effortful deliberation, takes on more responsibility, and is more likely to evoke regret than doing nothing. These are powerful forces that may guide the decision of someone who is otherwise unsure of what to do."
