            <p>Quotes and sections I liked from <i>Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman</i>
            <br>
            <br>
            "We are often confident even when we are wrong, and an objective observer is more likely to detect our errors than we are."
            <br>
            <br>
            "My intuitive impression could be due entirely to journalist's choices of topics and to my reliance on the availability heuristic"
            <br>
            <br>
            "our excessive confidence in what we know, and our apparent inability to acknowledge the full extent of our ignorance and the uncertainty of the world we live in. We are prone to overestimate how much we understand about the world and underestimate the role of chance in events. Overconfidence is fed by the illusory certainty of hindsight."
            <br>
            <br>
            "we can be blind to the obvious, and we are also blind to our blindness"

            <br>
            "One of the significant discoveries of cognitive psychologists in recent decades is that switching from one task to another is effortful, especially under time pressure" -> FOCUS, do one thing at a time
            <br>
            <br>
            "People who are cognitively busy are more likely to make selfish choices, use sexist language, and make superficial judgements in social situations."
            <br>
            <br>
            "Another major advance in our understanding of memory was the discovery that priming is not restricted to concepts and words."

            <br>
            <br>
            "the common admonition to "act kind and calm regardless of how you feel" is very good advice: you are likely to be rewarded by actually feeling calm and kind"
            <br>
            <br>
            "a purely symbolic reminder of being watched prodded people into improved behaviour."

            "People who are repeatedly exposed to the phrase "the body temperature of a chicken" were more likely to accept the statement that "the body temperature of a chicken is 144 degrees" (or any other arbitrary number). The familiarity of one phrase in the statement sufficed to make the whole statement feel familiar, and therefore true." -> use in business, specifically copywriting
            <br>
            <br>
            "Compare these two statements:
            <br>

            <b>Adolf Hitler was born in 1892</b>
            <br>
            Adolf Hitler was born in 1887
            <br>
            <br>
            Both are false (Hitler was born in 1889), but experiments have shown that the first is more likely to be believed."
            <br>
            <br>
            "if your message is to be printed use high quality paper to maximise contrast", "If you use colour, you are more likely to be believed if your text is printed in bright blue or red than in middling shades of green, yellow or pale blue.", "If you care about being thought credible and intelligent, do not use complex language where simpler language will do"
            <br>
            <br>
            "In addition to making your message simple, try to make it memorable.", "Participants in a much cited experiment read dozens of unfamiliar aphorisms... The aphorisms were judged more insightful when they rhymed than when they did not."
            <br>

            "if you quote a source, choose one with a name that is easy to pronounce."
            <br>
            <br>
            "If possible, the recipients of your message want to stay away from anything that reminds them of effort, including a source with a complicated name."
            <br>
            <br>
            "The experimenters recruited 40 Princeton students to take the CRT. Half of them saw the puzzles in a small font in washed-out grey print. The puzzles were legible, but the font induced cognitive strain. The results tell a clear story: 90% of the students who saw the CRT in normal font made at least on mistake in the test, but the proportion dropped to 35% when the font was barely legible... Cognitive strain, whatever its source, mobilizes System 2, which is more likely to reject the intuitive answer suggested by System 1."

            "cognitive ease is associated with good feelings"

            "companies with pronounceable names do better than others for the first week after the stock is issued, though the effect disappears over time.", "Stocks with pronounceable trading symbols (like KAR or LUNMOO) outperform those with tongue-twisting tickers like PXG or RD--and they appear to retain a small advantage over some time."
            <br>
            <br>
            <i>The mere exposure effect</i> - "the words that were presented more frequently were rated much more favourably than the words that had been shown only once or twice.", this effect can also be seen in nature -> animal sees novel stimulus = fear, over time if nothing bad happens that specific stimulus = safe, safe = good.
            <br>
            <br>
            "We are evidently ready at birth to have <i>impressions</i> of causality, which do not depend on reasoning about patterns of causation. They are products of System 1."
            <br>
            <br>
            "The operations of associative memory contribute to a general <i>confirmation bias</i> ... A deliberate search for confirming evidence, know as <i>positive test strategy</i>, is how System 2 tests a hypothesis... people (and scientists, quite often) seek data that are likely to be compatible with the beliefs they currently hold."

            "The tendency to like (or dislike) everything about a person--including things you have not observed-is known as the <i>halo effect</i>."

            "The initial traits in the list change the very meaning of the traits that appear later" -> Solomon Asch personality trait study.

            "To derive the most useful information from multiple sources of evidence, you should always make sure that the sources are independent of each other."

            <br>
            "The standard practice of open discussion gives too much weight to the opinions of those who speak early and assertively, causing others to line up behind."

            Alex Todorov political faces rated on likeability, competence, etc "In 70% of the race for senator, congressman, and governor, the election winner was the candidate who's face had earned a higher rating of competence.", "people judge competence by combining the two dimensions of strength and trustworthiness"
            <br>
            <br>
            "Different groups of participants stated their willingness to pay to save 2,000, 20,000, or 200,000 birds... the average contributions of these three groups were $80, $78and $88 respectively... The almost complete neglect of quantity in such emotional contexts has been confirmed many times."

            "The technical definition of heuristic is a simple procedure that helps find adequate, though often imperfect, answers to difficult questions."
            <br>
            <br>
            "System 1 often makes this move when faced with difficult target questions, if the answer to a related and easier heuristic question comes readily to mind."
            <br>
            <br>
            "The mental shotgun makes it easy to generate quick answers to difficult questions without imposing much hard work on your lazy System 2."

            <br>
            "The psychologist Paul Slovic has proposed an *affect heuristic* in which people let their likes and dislikes determine their beliefs about the world."
            <br>
            <br>
            System 1 "generates impressions, feelings, and inclinations; when endorsed by System 2 these become beliefs, attitudes, and intentions."
            <br>
            <br>
            "extreme outcomes (both high and low) are more likely to be found in small than in large samples."

            "an <i>anchoring effect</i>... occurs when people consider a particular value for an unknown quantity before estimating that quantity", "if you were asked whether Gandhi was more than 114 years old when he died you will end up with a much higher estimate of his age of death than if the anchoring question referred to death at 35."
            <br>
            <br>
            "people who are instructed to shake their head when they hear the anchor, as if they rejected it, move farther from the anchor, and people who nod their head show enhanced anchoring."
            <br>
            <br>
            "Insufficient adjustment is a failure of a weak or lazy System 2."
            <br>
            <br>
            "My hunch was that anchoring was a case of suggestion. This is the word we use when someone causes us to hear, see, or feel something by merely bringing it to mind. For example, the question 'Do you feel a slight numbness in your left leg?' always prompts quite a few people to report that their left leg does indeed feel a little strange."
            <br>
            <br>
            "the role of <i>associative coherence</i> in anchoring.", "In one experiment, they asked an anchoring question about temperature: 'Is the annual mean temperature in Germany higher or lower than 20C (68F)?' Or, 'Is the annual mean temperature in Germany higher or lower than 5C (41F)?' All participants were the briefly shown words that they were asked to identify. The researchers found that 68F made it easier to recognise summer words (like *sun* and *beach*), and 40F facilitated winter words (like *frost* and *ski*)... the high and low numbers activate different sets of ideas in memory."
            <br>
            <br>
            <i>the anchoring index</i>: "Is the heigh of the tallest redwood more or less than 1,200 feet?", "What is your best guess about the height of the tallest redwood?", "For other participants, the first question referred to a 'low anchor' of 180 feet", "The difference between the two anchors was 1,020 feet", "As expected, the two groups produced very different mean estimates: 844 and 282 feet", "the anchoring index ratio is simply the ratio of the two differences (562/1,020), expressed as a percentage: 55%", "The value observed of 55% in this experiment is typical."
            <br>
            <br>
            "Powerful anchoring effects are found in decisions that people make about money.", e.g. the real estate agent house valuation example with high and low price anchors, 41% anchoring, AND said they weren't influenced by the price shown
            <br>
            <br>
            "a key finding in anchoring research is that anchors that are obviously random can be just as effective as potentially informative anchors. When we used a wheel of fortune to anchor estimates of the proportion of African nations in the UN, the anchoring index was 44%, well within the range of effects observed with anchors that could plausibly be taken as hints."
            <br>
            <br>
            German judges said they would sentence someone to a different number of months in jail when they were anchored to a weighted die roll of either 9 or 3. The anchoring effect was 50%.
            <br>
            <br>
            "supermarket shoppers is Sioux City, Iowa, encountered a sales promotion for Campbells soup at about 10% off the regular price. On some days a sign on the shelf said <i>limit of 12 per person</i>. On other days, the sign said *no limit per person*. Shoppers purchased an average of 7 cans when the limit was in force, twice as many as when the limit was removed. Anchoring is not the sole explanation. Rationing also implies that the goods are flying off the shelves, and shoppers should feel some urgency about stocking up."
            <br>
            <br>
            "The participants who have been exposed to random or absurd anchors (such as Gandhi's death at 144) confidently deny that this obviously useless information could have influenced their estimate, and they are wrong."
            <br>
            <br>
            "you should assume that any number that is on the table has had an anchoring effect on you, and if the stakes are high you should mobilize yourself (your System 2) to combat the effect."
            <br>
            <br>
            "We defined <i>the availability heuristic</i> as the process of judging frequency by 'the ease at which instances come to mind'."
            <br>
            <br>
            "The availability heuristic, like other heuristics of judgement, substitutes one question for another: you wish to estimate the size of a category or the frequency of the event, but you report am impression of the ease with which instances come to mind."
            <br>
            <br>
            "One of the best-known studies of availability suggests that awareness of your own biases can contribute to peace in marriages, and probably in other joint projects."
            <br>
            <br>
            "The same bias contributes to the common observation that many members of a collaborative team feel they have done more than their share and also feel that the others are not adequately grateful for the individual contributions."
            <br>
            <br>
            "The experience of fluent retrieval of instances trumped the number retrieved.", how easy it is to retrieve items has more effect on the bias that how many items you retrieved 
            <br>
            <br>
            "A professor at UCLA found a group of ingenious ways to exploit the availability bias. He asked different groups of students to list ways to improve the course, and he varied the required number of improvements. As expected, students who listed more ways to improve the class rated it higher."
            <br>
            <br>
            "The proof that you truly understand a pattern of behaviour is that you know how to reverse it."
            <br>
            <br>
            "It is the unexpectedly low fluency that causes people who were asked for twelve instances to describe themselves as unassertive. When the surprise is eliminated, low fluency no longer influences the judgement."
            <br>
            <br>
            "The lesson is clear: estimates of causes of death are warped by media coverage. The coverage is itself biased toward novelty and poignancy, The media do not just shape what the public is interested in, but also are shaped by it."
            <br>
            <br>
            "Slovic eventually developed the notion of an affect heuristic, in which people make judgementss and decision by consulting their emotions: Do I like it? Do I hate it? How strongly do I feel about it? In many domains of life, Slovic said, people form opinions and make choices that directly express their feelings and their basic tendency to approach or avoid, often without knowing that they are doing so. The affect heuristic is an instance of substitution, in which the answer to an easy question (How do I feel about it?) serves as an answer to a much harder question (What do I think about it?)."
            <br>
            <br>
            "the striking finding was that people who had received a message extolling the benefits of a technology also changed their beliefs about its risks. Although they had received no relevant evidence, the technology they now liked more than before was also perceived as less risky. Similarly, respondents who were told only that the risk of a technology were mild developed a more favourable view of its benefits."

            the Alar incident or Alar scare of 1989 "Alar is a chemical sprayed on apples... scare began with press stories that the chemical, when consumed in gigantic doses, caused tumours in rats and mice... The apple industry sustained large losses... Subsequent research confirmed that the substance might pose a very small risk as a possible carcinogen, but the Alar incident was certainly an enormous overreaction to a minor problem. The net effect of the incident on public health was probably detrimental because fewer good apples were consumed.", "The Alar incident illustrates a basic limitation in the ability of our mind to deal with small risks: we either ignore them altogether or give them far too much weight -- nothing in between."
            <br>

            "if you must guess whether a woman who is described as 'a shy poetry lover' studies Chinese literature or business administration, you should opt for the latter option. Even if every female student of Chinese literature is shy and loves poetry, it is almost certain that there are more bashful poetry lovers in the much larger population of business students."

            <i>Bayesian statistics</i> "This influential modern approach to statistics is named after an English minister pf the eighteenth century, the Reverend Thomas Bayes, who is credited with the first major contribution to a large problem: the logic of how people should change their mind in the light of evidence. Bayes's rule specifies how prior beliefs (in the examples of this chapter, base rates) should be combined with the diagnostic of the evidence, the degree to which it favours the hypothesis over the alternative."

            "The uncritical substitution of plausibility for probability has pernicious effects on judgement when scenarios are used as tools for forecasting. Consider these two scenarios, which were presented to different groups,, with a request to evaluate their probability.", "A massive flood somewhere in North America next year, in which more than 1,000 people drown.", "An earthquake in California sometime next year, causing a flood in which more than 1,000 people drown.", "The California earthquake scenario is more plausible than the North America scenario, although its probability is certainly smaller.", "This is a trap for forecasters and their clients: adding detail to scenarios makes them more persuasive, but less likely to come true."

            "an important principle of skill training: rewards for improved performance work better than punishment of mistakes", regression from the mean, do unusually bad = punish, do unusually good = reward BUT these are unusual results, the bad + punish will then (usually) become a more normal result (closer to the mean) and the good + reward will then also (usually) become a more normal result (closer to the mean). It seems like punish = improve and reward = get worse, but this isn't usually the case."

            "Highly intelligent women tend to marry men who are less intelligent than they are." - it is just due to regression towards the mean, the chance of someone of high intelligence marrying someone else of high intelligence is lower than the chance of someone with high intelligence marrying someone with average intelligence."
